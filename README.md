# Chore Chart App
An example React application by Lily Evans

### Project Management
Work for this project is tracked using [this Trello board](https://trello.com/b/bZuW3ohr/chore-chart-app).

The board is organized into four categories:
  1. **Pending**:  
    - outlines for tasks
    - not yet fully fleshed out
    - do not have a card number
  2. **To Do**:
    - complete cards with clear acceptance criteria (as a checklist when ACs are simple enough)
    - card number given in title
  3. **In Progress**:  
    - work in progress
    - associated commits have this card number in the commit message and are linked to the card via Trello Power-Up
  4. **Done**:  
    - passed all acceptance criteria

Cards are numbered according to the following scheme:
- final two digits represent the card's identifier within an iteration
- preceding digits designate the card's iteration number  

For example:  
  Card #001 is card one of iteration zero.  
  Card #101 is card one of iteration one.  
  Card #1001 is card one of iteration ten.
